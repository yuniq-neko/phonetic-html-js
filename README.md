# phonetic-html-js
A simple Jekyll Page that converts a String into Phonetics, Making it a quick simple paste and instantly having all needed phonetics.

Completed:
  - Phonetics into a JSON file...
  - Everything Else (Finally done! only took me 3 years to decide to finish this...)

The index.md file is designed to work with Jekyll, but its code gives the idea of how to integrate this code into your own projects.
Simply run this script on a page with a 'input' tag on a text box, and a 'output' tag anywhere else. Upon a change being detected in the text box (or generatePhonetics() being called elsewhere), the script will generate phonetics!
You can also change the 'input' and 'output' ID's at the top of the script. :)
A demo is available at [yuniq-neko.github.io/phonetics](https://yuniq-neko.github.io/phonetics)!
